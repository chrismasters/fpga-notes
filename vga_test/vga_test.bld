INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'clk', used in period specification
   'TS_CLK_IN1', was traced into DCM_SP instance cc/dcm_sp_inst. The following
   new TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP
   output(s): 
   CLKFX: <TIMESPEC TS_cc_clkfx = PERIOD "cc_clkfx" TS_CLK_IN1 / 0.78125 HIGH
   50% INPUT_JITTER 312.5 ps>

INFO:ConstraintSystem - The Period constraint <PERIOD=31.25ns;>
   [constraints.ucf(1)], is specified using the Net Period method which is not
   recommended. Please use the Timespec PERIOD method.
